    "# NumPy - fundamental package for scientific computing in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "![NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/_static/numpylogo.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    " `NumPy` (short for Numerical Python) is one of the foundational packages for numerical computations in Python. It provides support for large multidimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "## History of Numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numeric\n",
    "\n",
    "* Before NumPy, there was Numeric, sometimes referred to as \"Numerical.\" It was the original ancestor of NumPy and was developed by Jim Hugunin in the mid-1990s.\n",
    "* Numeric was the first widespread, efficient numerical programming library for Python, providing an array object and related operations.\n",
    "* Though it was a foundational library, it had some limitations and inefficiencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### numarray\n",
    "\n",
    "* Due to the limitations of Numeric, another array-processing package called numarray was developed, primarily by Perry Greenfield, Richard White,Jin-chung Hsu and Todd Miller from the Space Telescope Science Institute.\n",
    "* While numarray addressed many of the shortcomings of Numeric, especially for large arrays and offered new features, it wasn't backward compatible with Numeric. \n",
    "* This split in the community was problematic; some users preferred Numeric for its speed with small arrays, while others leaned towards numarray due to its broader feature set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "* To reconcile the bifurcation caused by Numeric and numarray, Travis Oliphant, a prominent figure in the scientific Python community, started the development of NumPy in 2005.\n",
    "* Travis Oliphant took the best parts of both Numeric and numarray and created NumPy. Essentially, it was a re-write that also included features from both predecessors.\n",
    "* NumPy 1.0 was released in 2006 and became the de facto standard for numerical operations in Python, bringing the community back together under a single, powerful library.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Community and continued development\n",
    "\n",
    "* Post the release, NumPy's popularity grew significantly, forming a strong foundation for other libraries like SciPy, Matplotlib, and later Pandas(to be seen later in the course).\n",
    "* Today, NumPy is maintained and improved by a vast community of contributors, ensuring its relevance and utility in the world of scientific computing.\n",
    "* The NumPy library has also been a core part of data science and machine learning projects in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### NumFocus\n",
    "\n",
    "* NumPy became a fiscally sponsored project of [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/), a non-profit in the U.S. This sponsorship has helped ensure the long-term sustainability of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
